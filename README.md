##Call Method
        This is also known as function borrowing.  
        With the help of call we can do function borrowing. We can borrow the fucntion from other object and use it with data of other object.

##Apply Method
        The only difference between call and apply method is the way of passing the second arguments.
        In call method we are passing it individually and in appy method we are passing it through array list.

##Bind Method
         It will gives the copy of function which can be invoke directly later.
